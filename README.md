<p>Call spoofing, also known as caller ID spoofing, is a technique that allows a caller to falsify the information displayed on the recipient's caller ID display. This means that when a call is received, the recipient's phone will show a different caller ID, which can be a different phone number or even a fake name.</p>

<P> Some individuals use call spoofing services to protect their privacy. For example, they may want to keep their personal phone number hidden when making business-related calls or when communicating with strangers they met online.</p>

<p>Criminals often use call spoofing to impersonate trusted entities, such as banks, government agencies, or well-known companies. They may pretend to be someone the recipient trusts in an attempt to trick them into providing sensitive information, such as credit card numbers or social security numbers.</p>

<p>Call spoofing is frequently used in various forms of fraud and social engineering schemes. For instance, scammers might impersonate tech support personnel and claim to fix non-existent computer issues, demanding payment for their services.</p>

<p>To protect against call spoofing and potential scams, it's essential to exercise caution when receiving calls, especially if the caller asks for personal or financial information. If you receive a suspicious call, consider verifying the caller's identity through official channels, such as calling back using a known and trusted phone number. Additionally, there are call-blocking apps and services that can help filter out unwanted and potentially fraudulent calls.</p>
